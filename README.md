#  Predicting Ad Conversion Using Neural Networks and Classical Machine Learning Models

## Problem Statement & Dataset

In todayâ€™s e-commerce landscape, understanding which ads convert is critical to optimizing digital strategy.  
This project explores how Machine Learning can predict **whether an ad will lead to conversion**, based on various features of Adidas product listings.  
We use a real-world dataset (`adidas_usa.csv`) with fields like price, availability, and product metadata to build our classification models.  
The goal: compare different ML strategiesâ€”Neural Networks with optimization techniques vs. classical ML models like Logistic Regression.

## Which Combination Worked Better?

The best F1 score was achieved by:
- **Model 2**: Adam Optimizer, L2 regularization, Learning Rate = 0.001, with Early Stopping
- **Model 4** (identical performance, different learning rate)

##  Neural Network vs Classical ML?

While both approaches performed similarly in this dataset, **Logistic Regression matched the neural networks** in all major metricsâ€”F1, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.

However, the **neural network models offered more flexibility** for applying optimization techniques like:
- Dropout
- Learning Rate tuning
- Early Stopping

This flexibility becomes critical with more complex, high-dimensional data.
